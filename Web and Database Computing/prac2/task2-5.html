        <h1>This page is all about divs!</h1>
        <p>This page looks much cleaner now that I've put my content in a div with a white background.</p>
        <p>Because this div is special it has it's own id, "content".<br>This allows us to differentiate it from other divs and give it a white background.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>This is a normal paragraph except <span class="blue">this span of text is blue </span><span class="fancy">and this span of text has a font-family of cursive,</span><br>because they belongs to two classes called "blue" and "fancy" respectively</p>
        <p>On the other hand, <span class="blue fancy">this span of text is both blue and fancy</span></p>
    </div>
    <p>This text is inside a normal div, but the background has not been set.</p>
