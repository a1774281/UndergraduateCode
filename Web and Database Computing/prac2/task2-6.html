        <h1>Check out my borders</h1>
        <p>We've modified the content div to have a 1px darkgrey border with rounded curves of 8px radius.</p>
        <p>Other elements can have borders too, <span class="red-border">like this span with the class red border</span>.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>You can change the color of horizontal rules by changing the border color;<br>all horizontal rules are now #9FEFE4.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, <span class="red-outline">this span has a red outline (red-outline class).</span><br>That prevents it from messing with the line height.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Notice how the borders double up here:</p>
    <div class="red-border">
        <p>This div has a red border</p>
    </div>
    <div class="blue-border">
        <p>This div has a blue border</p>
    </div>
    <p>Notice how this fixes the borders:</p>
    <div class="red-border-fixed">
        <p>This div has a red border, except on the bottom, and 8px round top corners</p>
    </div>
    <div class="blue-border-fixed">
        <p>This div has a blue border, and 8px round bottom corners</p>
    </div>
</body>
